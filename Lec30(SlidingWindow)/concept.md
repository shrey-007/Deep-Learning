## **📌 Sliding Window in Object Detection**  

The **Sliding Window** technique is a **brute-force approach** for object detection. It systematically scans an image at **multiple positions and scales** to locate objects.  


## **🔁 How Sliding Window Works?**  
The algorithm moves a fixed-size window over the image, checking each region for the presence of an object. It follows these steps:  

### **Step-by-Step Process**  

1️⃣ **Define a Window Size**  
   - Choose a **fixed-size** rectangular window (e.g., `64×64` pixels).  
   - The size should match the typical size of objects in the image.  

2️⃣ **Slide the Window Across the Image**  
   - Move the window **horizontally and vertically** in small steps (called **stride**).  
   - Extract the **sub-region** under the window for processing.  

3️⃣ **Apply Object Classification**  
   - Pass the extracted region to a **classifier (e.g., CNN, SVM, Haar cascade)**.  
   - The classifier **determines whether an object is present** in the region.  

4️⃣ **Multi-Scale Detection (Pyramid)**  
   - Repeat the process at **different scales** to detect objects of varying sizes.  
   - Downscale the image and reapply the sliding window.  

5️⃣ **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**  
   - Multiple overlapping windows may detect the same object.  
   - Apply **NMS** to keep the **highest confidence detection** and remove duplicates.

## **📌 Key Parameters in Sliding Window**  

| Parameter | Description | Effect |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Window Size** | Size of the scanning box | Affects object detection accuracy |
| **Stride** | Step size for movement | Small stride = better accuracy, but slower |
| **Scaling Factor** | Factor to resize image in multi-scale detection | Allows detecting objects of different sizes |

## **🚀 Advantages & Limitations**  

✅ **Advantages:**  
✔ Works with traditional machine learning models (**SVM, Haar cascades**).  
✔ Ensures **exhaustive search** for objects.  

❌ **Limitations:**  
✖ **Computationally expensive** – High number of window scans.  
✖ **Slow for large images** – Too many windows to evaluate.  
✖ **Fixed window sizes** – May miss objects of varying shapes.

## **🔍 Modern Approaches (Better than Sliding Window)**  
📌 **CNN-Based Object Detectors**:  
- **Region-Based CNN (R-CNN)** – Selects potential object regions first (avoiding exhaustive search).  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** – Predicts **all objects in one forward pass**.  
- **SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)** – Uses feature maps at different scales.
