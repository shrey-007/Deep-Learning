### **What is LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)?**
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is an **advanced type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** designed to handle **long-term dependencies**. Unlike vanilla RNNs, which suffer from the **vanishing gradient problem**, LSTM effectively remembers important information over long sequences.

---

## **📌 How Does LSTM Work?**
LSTMs introduce a **memory cell** and **three gates** to control the flow of information.

🔹 **Memory Cell** (`Ct`): Stores important past information.  
🔹 **Forget Gate** (`ft`): Decides what to discard from memory.  
🔹 **Input Gate** (`it`): Decides what new information to store.  
🔹 **Output Gate** (`ot`): Controls what part of the memory is output.

At each time step **t**, LSTM processes an **input (Xt)**, updates its **hidden state (Ht)**, and maintains its **cell state (Ct)**.

---

## **📜 Step-by-Step Working of LSTM**
Each LSTM unit updates its **cell state** (`Ct`) and **hidden state** (`Ht`) using the following equations:

### **1️⃣ Forget Gate (`ft`)**
- Determines what part of the **previous cell state (Ct-1)** should be **forgotten**.
- Uses a **sigmoid activation** to output values between **0 (forget)** and **1 (keep)**.

\[
f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_f)
\]

🔹 If `ft = 0`, forgets that information.  
🔹 If `ft = 1`, retains that information.

---

### **2️⃣ Input Gate (`it`)**
- Decides what **new information** to store in the **cell state (`Ct`)**.
- Uses a **sigmoid function** to control **importance** and a **tanh function** to create **new candidate values (`C̃t`)**.

\[
i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_i)
\]  
\[
\tilde{C_t} = \tanh(W_C \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_C)
\]

🔹 `it` controls **how much** of `C̃t` should be added to `Ct`.  
🔹 `C̃t` contains **new candidate values** for memory.

---

### **3️⃣ Update Cell State (`Ct`)**
The **new cell state (`Ct`)** is updated by:
- Forgetting part of the old memory **(Ct-1)**.
- Adding new candidate values **(C̃t)** where **it > 0**.

\[
C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C_t}
\]

This allows **long-term memory retention** across time steps.

---

### **4️⃣ Output Gate (`ot`)**
- Determines **how much memory** (`Ct`) should be **exposed** as the new hidden state (`Ht`).
- Uses **sigmoid activation** (`ot`) to decide what part of memory should be **visible**.

\[
o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [H_{t-1}, X_t] + b_o)
\]  
\[
H_t = o_t * \tanh(C_t)
\]

🔹 `ot` decides how much of the memory should **affect the output**.  
🔹 The final hidden state `Ht` is passed to the next LSTM cell.

---

## **🔄 Summary of LSTM Workflow**
At each time step `t`:
1. **Forget gate (`ft`)** removes unimportant past data.
2. **Input gate (`it`)** selects important new data.
3. **Cell state (`Ct`)** updates using past memory (`Ct-1`) and new information (`C̃t`).
4. **Output gate (`ot`)** decides what part of the memory is visible as `Ht`.

## **🛠 LSTM in Fall Detection**
In **fall detection**, LSTM processes **sensor data** (accelerometer, gyroscope) or **pose sequences** (if using vision-based detection).

📌 **Example:** **Sensor-Based Fall Detection**  
| Time Step | Sensor Data (Xt) | Forget Gate (ft) | Cell State (Ct) | Output (Yt) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| t = 1 | Normal motion | Keeps memory | Stores normal motion | No Fall (0) |
| t = 2 | Slight tilt | Keeps memory | Stores tilt information | No Fall (0) |
| t = 3 | Sudden drop | Keeps memory | Recognizes fall pattern | Fall (1) |

## **📝 Key Advantages of LSTM**
✅ **Solves vanishing gradient problem** → Can remember long-term dependencies.  
✅ **Selective memory retention** → Learns which data is important.  
✅ **Works well with sequential data** → Best for fall detection, NLP, time-series forecasting.
