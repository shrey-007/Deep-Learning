**Deep Learning** is a subset of **Machine Learning** (ML) that uses **neural networks** with many layers (hence "deep") to model and solve complex problems. Here's how they differ:  

### **Machine Learning (ML):**
1. **Definition**: A field of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.
2. **Approach**: Often uses structured data and relies on feature extraction (manual or algorithm-driven).
3. **Examples of Techniques**:  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
4. **Application Scope**: Works well with smaller datasets and simpler patterns.

### **Deep Learning (DL):**
1. **Definition**: A subfield of ML focused on using artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model hierarchical patterns in data.
2. **Approach**: Automates feature extraction by learning features directly from raw data (images, audio, text, etc.).
3. **Architecture**: Uses multi-layered neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for images or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequences.
4. **Data Requirements**: Requires large amounts of labeled data and high computational power (e.g., GPUs/TPUs).
5. **Examples**:  
   - Image Classification (e.g., cats vs. dogs)  
   - Natural Language Processing (e.g., chatbots)  
   - Autonomous Vehicles  

### **Key Differences:**
| **Aspect**               | **Machine Learning**                                | **Deep Learning**                           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Feature Extraction**    | Manual                                             | Automatic                                   |
| **Data Requirement**      | Less data needed                                   | Requires large datasets                     |
| **Complexity**            | Simpler problems                                   | Complex problems                            |
| **Performance**           | Limited for unstructured data                     | Excels in unstructured data (images, text)  |
| **Computation**           | Less computationally intensive                    | Requires more computational resources       |

Deep Learning is often considered the next step in ML for handling highly complex tasks, particularly where data is vast and unstructured.
