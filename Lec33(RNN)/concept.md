### **What is RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)?**
A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** is a type of neural network designed for **sequential data processing**. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have **loops** that allow them to **maintain memory of past inputs** while processing current inputs. This makes them suitable for tasks like **speech recognition, language modeling, time series prediction, and video analysis**.

### **Where is RNN Used?**
RNNs are widely used in:
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** â€“ Machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis.
2. **Speech Recognition** â€“ Converting speech into text (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant).
3. **Time Series Forecasting** â€“ Stock market predictions, weather forecasting.
4. **Video Analysis** â€“ Action recognition in videos.
5. **Anomaly Detection** â€“ Detecting unusual behavior in network security or medical monitoring.

### **Step-by-Step Process of RNN**
#### **Step 1: Input Data Processing**
- The input data (sequence) is prepared. If dealing with text, it is tokenized into words or characters.
- Convert input into numerical representation (embedding or one-hot encoding).

#### **Step 2: Initialize RNN Weights**
- Weights for **input to hidden layer**, **hidden to hidden layer**, and **hidden to output layer** are initialized.
- The hidden state **stores past information** and is updated at each step.

#### **Step 3: Forward Propagation**
- The input **Xt** (at time step t) is passed to the network.
- The hidden state **Ht** is updated using the previous hidden state and the current input:
  \[
  H_t = f(W_x X_t + W_h H_{t-1} + b)
  \]
  where **f** is an activation function (like tanh or ReLU).
- The output **Yt** is computed from **Ht**.

#### **Step 4: Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**
- Compute the loss using a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification).
- Gradients are calculated for all time steps using **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**.
- Adjust weights using optimization (e.g., Adam, SGD).

#### **Step 5: Handling Long Sequences (If Needed)**
- **Vanishing Gradient Problem**: If sequences are long, gradients may become too small (vanish), making training difficult.
- **Solutions**:
    - Use **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory)** or **GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units)** instead of simple RNNs.
    - Use **gradient clipping** to prevent large updates.

#### **Step 6: Prediction & Evaluation**
- After training, the RNN is used for predictions on new data.
- Performance is evaluated using accuracy, perplexity (for text), or MSE (for regression).
