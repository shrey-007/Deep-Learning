### **Types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**

RNNs come in different architectures based on how information flows through the network. The major types are:

---

### **1. Vanilla RNN (Simple RNN)**
- The basic form of RNN where each neuron maintains a **hidden state** that is passed to the next time step.
- Struggles with **long-term dependencies** due to the **vanishing gradient problem**.

💡 **Use Cases:**
- Simple sequence prediction
- Basic text generation
- Small-scale time series forecasting

---

### **2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- An advanced type of RNN that solves the **vanishing gradient problem** using special memory cells.
- Contains **three gates**:
    1. **Forget Gate** – Decides what information to discard.
    2. **Input Gate** – Decides what new information to store.
    3. **Output Gate** – Generates the output based on memory.

💡 **Use Cases:**
- Text generation (e.g., chatbots, autocomplete)
- Speech recognition
- Video captioning

---

### **3. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
- A **simplified version of LSTM** with only **two gates**:
    1. **Reset Gate** – Controls how much past information is forgotten.
    2. **Update Gate** – Controls how much past information is passed forward.
- Faster and computationally efficient compared to LSTM.

💡 **Use Cases:**
- Real-time applications (e.g., speech synthesis, language translation)
- Sentiment analysis

---

### **4. Bidirectional RNN (Bi-RNN)**
- Processes input in **both forward and backward directions**, capturing **past and future context**.
- Useful when the entire sequence is available before prediction.

💡 **Use Cases:**
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Machine Translation
- Speech recognition

---

### **5. Encoder-Decoder RNN**
- Used in **sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) tasks** where input and output sequences have different lengths.
- **Encoder** processes the input into a context vector.
- **Decoder** generates the output step by step.

💡 **Use Cases:**
- Language translation (e.g., Google Translate)
- Text summarization
- Image captioning

---

### **6. Transformer-Based RNN (Modern Approach)**
- Though not strictly an RNN, **Transformers** (like BERT, GPT) have largely replaced RNNs in NLP tasks.
- Uses **self-attention** instead of recurrence, making training faster and handling long-range dependencies better.

💡 **Use Cases:**
- ChatGPT, BERT, GPT models
- Advanced NLP applications
